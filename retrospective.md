# Final Project Retrospective

## Team Members
- Student 1: Ralph Anthony Rafael
- Student 2: Tyrell Marcus Teppang

## 1. How did you divide the work between you and your partner?
_(Who worked on which features? How was the work assigned or negotiated?)_
We split the features evenly: Tyrell took registration and storefront while Ralph took product management and filtering. We had a Google doc which helped us track the required things we still need. From there we had constant communication to help resolve wach others errors if there were any.

## 2. What Git strategies or commands helped you most during the project?
_(E.g., branching, rebasing, frequent commits, etc.)_

Of course we used the standard pull, push,add etc. However, we also had to rebase our branches especially if the feature was connected to another feature a different person was working on. For example when store_view was updated since the other person's changes we merged to main, we had to rebase our current branch to account for the updates each person created.

## 3. Describe a merge conflict you encountered. What caused it and how did you resolve it?
_(Include any lessons learned or techniques used to resolve the issue.)_
We encountered conflicts especially in the store_view.pseudo. Since it was a file the multiple features were utilizing, it was contantly being updated with new code. So when we had to rebase and pull each others' changes, we had to resolve the conflicts. Through communication and VScode's features of being able to visualize the incoming and local versions, we were able to resolve everything

## 4. What were the biggest challenges you faced as a team?
_(This can include communication, Git usage, or coordination.)_

As this was our first time working together, one of the challenges we faced was Git usage. We were both already familiar with using Git individually. However, during collaboration, we didn't know what would happen if we ran certain commands like git merge. As we worked on the project, we became more familiar with collaborative Git. It was only that initial unfamiliarity that held us back.

## 5. What did you learn about using Git in a collaborative setting?
_(Any insights or habits youâ€™d apply in future projects?)_

Using Git in a collaborative setting helped me realize how powerful and flexible it is to be working on different features on a single project. Even with conflicting edits, these can easily be resolved through proper communication.

One habit we would definitely apply in future projects is the use of a note-taking application, such as GDocs, to lay out plans and ideas first. We'd also create a checkbox list to ensure everyone is on the same page before proceeding with the technical aspects.

## 6. How would you improve your workflow next time?
_(Think about technical habits and teamwork practices.)_

Next time, we'll definitely prioritize more frequent and structured check-ins. Even though we communicated regularly on this project, we now know that dedicated planning sessions at the start of each work period would help us stay better aligned, especially when working on bigger, more complex projects.

## 7. Optional: Any feedback on the activity?
_(What worked well? What was confusing or could be improved?)_

This activity was a great hands-on experience for learning how to collaborate using Git. It helped us understand the importance of creating branches, writing clear commit messages, and resolving merge conflicts properly. We appreciated the practice of simulating real-world teamwork and coordinating code changes with a partner.
